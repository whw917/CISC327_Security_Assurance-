## ðŸ’º Project Requirement - CLI Option

The product you are to design and build is the SeetGeek not SeatGeek online Customer-to-Customer ticket selling system.
A registered user can buy and sell tickets through this online application.

The second option is the original project design in the past. It is a CLI-based application. 
The actor interacts with the system through the terminal, 
and the UI testing is done by running the program with a sequence of coded user inputs. 
There is a front-end component and a backend component.
Unlike the above web application, they are two different programs and not synchronized. 
The front-end first runs during the day in different locations (such as Kingston, Toronto, and Montreal, etc), yield transaction files.
Then the backend merges the transactions and yields the new account details and available tickets for the next day.


If there are any conflicts (such as the same ticket sold to different people, not enough balance), the backend office will simply log errors and let the customer services to call and resolve issues. We also provide a GitHub testing template we created last year with pytest [here](https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/CI-Python/tree/python-cli-with-pytest).

## :fire: Specification - CLI Option

The CLI application handles a sequence of INPUTS performed by the user on their terminal. 
The frontend is a standalone program that takes some arguments, interacts with users, and exits with output files.

|  |  |  |
|-|-|-|
| Program input | 1st argument | String - office location (e.g. Kingston) |
|  | 2nd argument | Path of a CSV file that contains user_email, user_name, user_password, balance. We denote this file as a valid account list file. |
|  | 3rd argument | Path of a CSV file that contains ticket_name, ticket_price, ticket_quality, owner_email. We denote this file as a valid ticket list file. |
|  |  |  |
| Program output |  | A file named [office_location]_transactions.csv (for example, if the program is ran with 1st argument of `kingston`, the file is `kingston_transactions.csv` |
|  |  | This csv file contains the updated list of format:  |
|  |  | for user related transaction (e.g. registration): transaction_name, user_name, user_email, user_password, balance |
|  |  | for ticket related transaction (e.g. sell): transaction_name, user_name, ticket_name, ticket_price, quantity |


The program interacts with the user through different sessions:


|  |  |  |
|-|-|-|
| Sessions | name |  description |
|  | landing | The landing screen (print out available commands) |
|  | login | The user login session (ask for user inputs to login) |
|  | register | The user registration session (ask for user information to register) |
|  | buy | The ticket buying session (ask for ticket info for purchase) |
|  | sell | The ticket selling session (ask for ticket info for sale) |
|  | update | The ticket updating session (ask for ticket info as an update) |


Landing screen details:

|  |  |  |
|-|-|-|
| R1 | landing | If logged in, show the menu item buy, sell, update, and logout. Also, print out the user's balance. |
|  |  | otherwise, show the menu item login, register, and exits. |
|  |  | The landing screen can take commands and go to corresponding sessions |
|  |  | if not logged in, no commands other than login and register are accepted |
|  |  | if logged in, no commands other than buy, sell, logout is accepted |


Sessions and Transactions Detail:

|  | Transaction/Command/Session |  |
|-|-|-|
| R2 | register | Command invalid if the user has logged in. |

|  |  | For any formatting errors, show message '{} format is incorrect.'.format(the_corresponding_attribute), end the registration session, and print the landing screen |
|  |  | Otherwise, show message 'account registered', end the registration session/process, print the landing screen according to R1 |
|  |  | New account will get a balance of 3000.  |
