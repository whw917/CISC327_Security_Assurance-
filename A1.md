# Test plan

- **How did your team organize the documentations of the test cases (e.g. where did you store the test case markdown file for each team member).**

  First we separated the test cases to everyone. Base on the different functions of each case, we classified R1 and R8 to one teammate, R2 to one teammate, R3 and R7 to one teammate and R4, R5 and R6 to one teammate. Zhiyingn Guo is responsible for R1 and R8, Haowen Wang is responsible for R2, Runbo Fang is responsible for R3 and R7 and Tiancheng Yang is responsible for R4, R5 and R6. Then we did our parts individually in our own local repository and git-pushed it to our own branch in our remote project repository. After our teammates uploaded their markdown files through GitHub, each of us will pull the newly changed document down in our local files, and modified it correspondingly. After we modified our part of the test case, we pushed the new version of file into different branches and we through pull request to merge our testcase to one md file named A1, and modified the format for A1. Runbo is responsible for Q1 write-up, Haowen is  responsible for Q2 write-up and Tiancheng is responsible for Q3 write-up, correction and formatting.

  We stored all test case table and natural language markdown in this file. Since we did a clear heading for each specification, it is easy to check the content and modify it in the following development by using Typora.

- **Your understanding of how the chosen testing framework works to test the frontend, including your understandings of when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub.**

  For CLI option, we think the front end is tested by two or more different testing approaches, which will generate the same output. Afterwards, the output of different testing approaches will be compared and should generate the same result. When each of members upload their code and clone the source code in from Github, we should be able to run each test code depending on their language.

- **How are you going to organize different test case code files? (a folder for a specification?)**

  We planned to write 8 test code folders for front end (8 for 8 sessions). These files will be put in a folder named specification. In each session folder, there will be several test code files to test every specification of a session and one test code to test the whole session.
